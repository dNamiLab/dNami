dNami syntax
************

This section introduces the dNami syntax. By using the dNami syntax the 
user can easily translate differential equations into finite difference code.

Floats 
------

When adding a float to the pseudo-code in an ``equations.py`` file, it should be followed by the suffix ``_wp`` which makes sure the floating point constant has the correct working precision chosen in the ``genRhs.py``. For example:

.. code-block:: python 

   F = {'f' : ' 2.0_wp * [f]_1x ' }

In the Python layer, users are encouraged to use the ``dn.cst()`` function to ensure consistant floating-point precision across the layers.

Spatial derivatives
-------------------

.. warning::

    When specifying derivatives, make sure to leave at least one space after the ']_1x', ']_1y' or ']_1z' notation and the next symbol (this is so that the pseudo-code can be correctly understood and translated). For example:

   .. figure:: img/deriv_spacing.png
      :width: 60%
      :align: center
        


First order derivative syntax
=============================

The tables below show how to express derivatives in the dNami syntax in each of the three spatial directions.

Second order derivative syntax
==============================


To specify second order derivatives, two ways are currently possible. The user can directly specify a second derivative (discretised as a second derivative) or by taking the first derivative twice as detailed below. The two approaches are mathematically equivalent but will yields different results when discretised. The curly-bracket '}' symbol is used when taking a derivative inside another derivative. This approach can also be applied to cross-derivatives.

Higher order derivative syntax
===============================

To generate higher-order derivatives, the current stategy involves storing an intermediate derivative and then taking the derivative of that stored variable. This is illustrated in the 1D KdV equations in :doc:`/usage/quickstart` where the third order derivative of the field :math:`u` is computed by computing and storing the second order derivative and then taking the first derivative of that stored field when specifying the RHS: 

.. code-block:: python

	varstored = { 'u_xx' : {'symb':' [u]_2xx ','ind':1, 'static': False } }
	...
	RHS = {'u' : ' epsilon * u * [ u ]_1x + mu * [ u_xx ]_1x ',}
