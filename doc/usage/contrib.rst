Contributing examples and test cases
####################################

We look forward to seeing dNami used to solve problems from many different fields. If you would like to contribute an example, please prepare an ``exm/*``-like folder with the equations, numerics and a ``compute.py`` as well as a short write-up of the problem and dNami results in the :doc:`/usage/testcases/` section of the documentation. Then submit a pull request so that we can review it for acceptance. Thank you for helping us grow the example section.  

Extending the documentation
####################################

If you want to add additional content to the documentation, add/edit *.rst* files in the ``doc/usage``
directory and also update ``doc/index.rst`` (if necessary). Please make sure the documentation compiles locally before submitting a pull request. 

Issues and support
##################################

If you discover a bug or an issue with the code, please open an issue with a clear write-up of the problem and steps to replicate it for us to investigate.
