Welcome to dNami's documentation!
*********************************

**dNami** [di:n…ë:mi:] is an open-source multi-language (Python, Fortran, C) framework for solving systems of balance laws using explicit numerical schemes on structured meshes. dNami uses MPI, OpenMP, loop-unrolling and cache-blocking techniques to speed up stencil-based operations.
