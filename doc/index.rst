*********************************

**dNami** is an open-source multi-language (Python, Fortran, C) framework for solving systems of balance laws using explicit numerical schemes on structured meshes. dNami uses MPI, OpenMP and cache blocking technics to speed up stencil-based operations.

To get started with dNami, please check out the Quickstart guide to get set up with dependencies and run your first dNami case.
