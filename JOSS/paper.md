# Summary

Solving \autoref{eq:gov_eq} 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:gov_eq}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \textbf{q} = \textbf{RHS}(\textbf{q})
\end{equation}

# Statement of need


# Features 

Specification of governing equations in symbolic form. Automatic translation to FORTRAN. Flexiblility of finite difference scheme (stencil and order) and filter. Speed with FORTRAN code. Interaction with the python interface at runtime.   



# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
